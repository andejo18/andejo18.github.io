              <h4>Sterograms for Solo Bass Trombone - David W. Brubeck(b. 1966)</h4>
              <p>David William Brubeck, a bass trombonist himself, wrote a collection of performance etudes, each etude dedicated to an influence in his playing and compositional life. The studies are divided into two volumes: No. 1-10: Three smooth stones and No. 11-20 Modern Renaissance.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row text-center">
              <p>No. 1, dedicated to James Pankow of the jazz-rock group Chicago, is actually the second study Brubeck composed but thought it was a good introduction to the lyricism of the first volume. No. 1 is essentially a two-part Stereogram, which is essentially the idea of playing two to three separate parts within a single 'melodic' line.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row text-center">
              <p>No. 10, dedicated to Gustav Holst, a trombonist himself, who is most famous for his seven movement orchestral work, The Planets. Stereogram No. 10 is subtitled "trOmBOnE" and is instructed to be played slowly and bittersweet.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row text-center">
              <p>No. 14., dedicated to Tommy Pederson, primarily a big bands and studio recording trombonist, as well as composer and arranger. Mr. Pederson wrote some of the earliest original etudes and chamber music for the modern bass trombone.</p>

            <h4>Concertino for Trombone Solo and Flute, Oboe, Clarinet, Bassoon - Raymond Premru(1934-1998)</h4>
            <p>Raymond Eugene Premru (1934-1998) wrote this work for trombone solo with woodwind quartet (1954) while studying trombone and composition at Eastman. Althought this is a trombone concertino, the woodwinds are of equal importance much of the time. Althought trombone is not a common substituation in woodwind quintet literature, Premru started a tradition of young composers writing for woodwind instruments and trombone.</p>

            <h4>Memorial Music For Reginald Fink and Raymond Premru - Walter S. Hartley(b. 1927)</h4>
              <p>Walter S. Hartley's Memorial Music(1998) is written in memory of Raymond Premru, his teacher, and Reginald Fink, another Eastman School of Music graduate. Fink is world-renowned for his educational publications and method books for trombone, bass trombone, and tuba. Hartley may be most known for his repertoire in the saxophone world. However, his list of compositions and arrangements exceeds 300 dating from 1949 on. In this work, Hartley uses many of the techniques Premru was experimenting with in the concertino. Some of the mimicking is almost as if Hartley specifically listened to the concertino while composing this memorial.</p>

            <h4>Eagles Landing - Michael Davis</h4>
              <p>Eagles Landing by Micheal Davis is written for tenor trombone and bass trombone with CD accompaniment. Davis is well known for his commercial works for trombone. He settled in Manhattan in the mid 1980's and started Hip-Bone Music(2005), a website/business that handles his publishing activities and work as a recording artist. Davis was trained at an early age as both a commercial and orchestral trombonist. He is most famous for his time as a recording artist and on tour with the Rolling Stones. Davis can still be heard on many film scores and television shows.</p>
